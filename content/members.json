Joining the Michigan Sailing Team has pushed him into racing Lasers, keelboats, and match racing in addition to 420s and FJs, and he can't wait to help get the team to the next level of college sailing.",

He grew up with the University of Michigan in his backyard and frequented Baseline Lake with his parents well-before he ever imagined joining the Sailing Team that called that lake its home. Mitch has never sailed an Opti. His dad first taught him how to sail on a Hobie Wave and Laser Pico on Portage Lake at the Portage Yacht Club -- right next door to the UM Sailing Club. Since his high school didn't have a sailing team, Mitch competed in the Interlake and Laser racing series at Portage Lake. He later went on to takeover the Head Sailing Instructor position at PYC and revived the junior racing events hosted on Portage Lake. Mitch looks forward to serving as the Team's Financial Officer, and is excited to start building the Team's endowment to ensure sailing at Michigan stays active for years to come. ",

He has spent a lot of time in the Laser Radial class, competing in many minor western Michigan regattas. When he is not sailing, he enjoys playing basketball, hanging out with friends, or pretty much anything that involves swimming or being in water. ",
